# Snake-ASM
Assembly language version of Snake. The game was developed for use on a programmable logic device for which I had developed a system verilog implementation of a simplified MIPS processor. It utilizes a display implemented as an array of characters from a hard-coded character set and features a module to handle keyboard input. The only shortcoming of the game is that the pills for the snake to eat are read out of a pre-defined chunk of memory. This is because my MIPS implementation lacked a pseudo-random number generator for lack of time. The system verilog MIPS implementation is included.
